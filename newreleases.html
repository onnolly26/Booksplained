<h2>1964: Eyes of The Storm</h2>

<img src="Book Images/31.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>Taken with a 35mm camera by Paul McCartney, these largely unseen photographs capture the explosive period in which The Beatles 
became an international sensation and changed the course of music history forever. The story starts in England where they begin to 
really come to terms with their growing fame. It then follows the journey through each city: Liverpool, London, Paris, New York, 
Washington D.C. and finally Miami. This all takes place in a whirwind three month period from early December 1963 to the end of 
February in the following year. 1964: EYES OF THE STORM also includes:</p>

<li>A personal foreword in which McCartney recalls the pandemonium of British concert halls, candid recollections preceding each 
city portfolio that form an autobiographical account of the period McCartney remembers as the “Eyes of the Storm”, a coda 
with subsequent events in 1964, “Beatleland” - an essay by Harvard historian and New Yorker essayist Jill Lepore, describing how 
The Beatles became the first truly global mass culture phenomenon.</li>

<p>Handsomely designed, 1964: Eyes of the Storm creates an intensely dramatic record of The Beatles’ first transatlantic trip, 
documenting the radical shift in youth culture that crystallised in 1964. What sets this book apart from others is the sense of 
intimacy that the photos and descriptions create. The book’s title uses “eyes” to note that it wasn’t just one perspective, it was 
other bandmates taking photos, professional photographers shooting the group, security details looking after the group, and the 
thousands of fans that greeted them wherever they went. The ancillary texts are scene-setting but less interesting than McCartney’s 
own writing, including the introduction by historian Jill Lepore, who does a solid if dutiful job of placing the Beatles’ 1964 
experiences in the larger context of the world around them.</p>

<h2>The Five-Star Weekend</h2>

<img src="Book Images/32.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>THE FIVE STAR WEEKEND is a fabulous weekend read that seamlessly combines engaging characters, an intricate storyline, and 
a healthy dose of mystery and surprise twists.</p>

<p>Hollis Shaw’s life seems picture-perfect. She’s the creator of the popular food blog Hungry with Hollis and is married to 
Matthew, a heart surgeon. But after she and Matthew get into a heated argument one snowy morning, he leaves for the airport 
and is killed in a car accident. The cracks in Hollis’s perfect life—her strained marriage and her complicated relationship 
with her daughter, Caroline—grow deeper. Several months after Matthew’s death, Hollis is in a cloud of grief and tragedy. 
However, she stumbles upon an interesting idea: a “Five-Star Weekend.” This is where one woman organizes a trip for her best 
friend from each phase of her life: her teenage years, her twenties, her thirties and mid-life. The husband of Hollis’s childhood 
friend Tatum arranges for Hollis’s first love, Jack Finigan, to spend time with them, stirring up old feelings. Meanwhile, Tatum 
is forced to play nice with abrasive and elitist Dru-Ann, Hollis’s best friend from UNC Chapel Hill. Dru-Ann’s career as a 
prominent Chicago sports agent is on the line after her comments about a client’s mental health issues are misconstrued online. 
Brooke, Hollis’s friend from their thirties, has just discovered that her husband is having an inappropriate relationship with 
a woman at work. Again! And then there’s Gigi, a stranger to everyone (including Hollis) who reached out to Hollis through her 
blog.</p>

<p>Filled with the emotional depth and trademark cast-of-characters perspective of Hilderbrand’s novels, The Five-Star Weekend 
promises a story of a remarkable weekend in Nantucket between friends—old and new—like no other.</p>

<h2>How to Sell a Haunted House</h2>

<img src="Book Images/1.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>Campy, unexpectedly deep and as creepy as the dead eyes of a puppet at midnight in a gloomy room. HOW TO SELL A HAUNTED 
HOUSE is a tense, dark novel that looks at family trauma and a life-long sibling rivalry while also delivering a heaping 
serving of demonic puppets, violence & even undead squirrels.</p>

<p>Growing up, Louise wanted to move far from home because her mother was hard to deal with and she felt like her brother 
was her parents' favourite and got everything handed to him while she had to work for things. Now she's an adult, has her 
own daughter and rarely talks to her estranged brother who still lives back in Charleston.</p>

<p>She has no plans to go back home but when she learns her parents have died in an accident she must put everything aside, 
leave her daughter with her ex and travel home. In the aftermath of death, those left behind must deal with a lot of practical 
things on top of the emotional turmoil. And in Louise and her brother Mark's case the biggest things are her parents' house, 
full of her mother's folk art, plus a big collection of dolls and homemade puppets.</p>

<p>How To Sell a Haunted House is an entertaining read that morphs into something new at least a few times. The first third 
of the book is all about Louise's heartbreak, an introduction to the house's eerie vibes and Louise learning the her brother 
has gotten everything despite being a mess who keeps getting fired from shitty jobs. Soon after Louise is attacked by the 
taxidermied squirrels from a Nativity set at the house and the narrative switches points of view to show Mark's side of the 
story.</p>

<h2>Spare</h2>

<img src="Book Images/2.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>SPARE is a memoir by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. The book was ghostwritten by J. R. Moehringer and first published in 
January 2023. The memoir'stitle highlights Prince Harry's position as Prince Charles' "Spare" (contingency heir) in contrast 
to Prince William's role as "Heir". The narrative recounts the prince's struggle to come to terms with his mother's death and 
his pursuit of love and purpose. While outlining his reasons for breaking away from the royal family and leaving Britain, 
Prince Harry highlights the restrictions of royal life, the effects of press harrassment as well as strained relationships 
with his father and brother.</p>

<p>Before losing his mother, 12-year-old Prince Harry was known as the carefree one, the happy-go-lucky Spare to the more 
serious Heir. Grief changed everything. He struggled at school, struggled with anger, with loneliness - and, because he blamed 
the press for his mother's death, he struggled to accept life in the spotlight.</p>

<p>At 21, he joined the British Army. The discipline gave him structure and two combat tours made him a hero at home. But he 
soon felt more lost than ever, suffering from post-traumatic stress and becoming prone to crippling panic attacks. Above all, 
he couldn't find true love. Then he met Meghan...</p>

<p>For the first time, Prince Harry tells his own story, chronicling his journey with raw, unflinching honesty. A landmark 
publication, Spare is full of insight, revelation, self-examination and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.</p>

<h2>Hello Beautiful</h2>

<img src="Book Images/3.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>HELLO BEAUTIFUL is a triumphant, emotionally resonant story about the transformative power of love. It is also inspired by 
the beauty and growth that come with meeting others as we are while accepting them the same way. A sweeping, perceptive and 
beautifully rendered family saga like this could only be achieved by an author at the height of her literary powers. Without a 
doubt there is a lot to reflect on and discuss while making deeper connections in this generous, healing novel.</p>

<p>Napolitano explores the meaning of love and family with this striking story of four Chicago sisters and the young man who 
enters their lives. William Waters, a basketball player from outside Boston, enrols at Northwestern in 1978 on an athletic 
scholarship. After he starts dating fellow student Julia Padavano, he's embraced by Julia's three younger sisters - Sylive, a 
romantic searching for a great love affair; Cecelia, an aspiring artist; and Cecelia's earnest but quiet twin, Emeline - and 
is delihted to find a family so different from his own, his parents having grown tacitun after his older sister's 
death years before.</p>

<p>William and Julia marry, while the unmarried Cecelia gets pregnant at 17, Sylvie presses on with a job at a library and 
Emeline works at a daycarewhere she fosters a crush on a coworker. After one character attempts suicide, the bonds of the 
expanding family are tested and the Padavano women re-examine the limits of how much they're willing to sacrifice. The author 
breathes great life into her characters and brings insight into their quiet moments as they gradually come into their own.</p>

<p>This is set to move critics and readers alike.</p>

<h2>Age of Vice</h2>

<img src="Book Images/4.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>Deftly shifting through time and perspective in contemporary India, AGE OF VICE is an epic, action-packed story propelled 
by the seductive wealth, startling corruption and bloodthirsty violence of the Wadia family - loved by few, loathed by many, 
feared by all.</p>

<p>In New Dehli at 3 a.m. a speeding Mercedes jumps the kerb and in the blink of an eye five people are dead. It's a rich man's 
car but when the dust settles there's no man at all, just a shell-shocked servant who cannot explain the strange series of events 
that led to this crime. Nor can he forsee the dark drama that is about to unfold.</p>

<p>In the shadow of lavish estates, extravagant parties, predatory business deals & calculated political influence, three 
lives become dangerously intertwined. Ajay is the watchful servant, born into poverty, who rises through the family ranks. 
Sunny is the playboy heir who dreams of outshining his father, whatever the cost. Neda is the curious journalist caught between 
morality and desire. Against a sweeping plot fuelled by loss, pleasure, greed, yearning, violence and revenge, will these 
characters' connections become a path to escape or a trigger for further destruction?</p>

<p>Just as much of a crime thriller as it is a family saga, we are transported from the dusty villages of Uttar Pradesh to the 
urban energy of New Dehli. This intoxicating novel portrays gangsters, lovers, false friendships, forbidden romance and 
the consequences of corruption. Pleasure and power are everything while the family ties that bind can also kill. It is binge-worthy 
entertainment at its literary best.</p>

<p>Fizzing with romance, wit and characters to fall head over heels for, HAPPY PLACE is a gloriously feelgood novel of fake 
relationships and awkward holidays from an author who never fails to deliver great banter and a romance to swoon over.</p>

<p>Harriet and Wyn are the perfect couple - they go together like bread and butter, gin and tonic or Blake Lively and Ryan 
Reynolds. Except now they don't. They broke up six months ago and still haven't told anyone. That's how they ended up sharing 
a bedroom at the cottage that has been a yearly getaway with their best friends for the past decade. For one glorious week 
they leave behind their lives, drink far too much wine and soak up the sea air with their favourite people. This is their annual 
respite from the world where they leave their daily lives behind for one vibrant, blissful week.</p>

<p>Only this year, Harriet and Wyn are lying through their teeth. The cottage is for sale so this is the last time they'll all 
be together and they couldn't bear breaking their friends hearts. Harriet will be the driven, surgical resident who never starts 
a fight. Wyn will be the laid-back charmer who never lets the cracks show. It's a flawless plan, in theory. How can you pretend 
to be in love with someone - and get away with it - in front of the people who know you best?</p>

<h2>I Have Some Questions for You</h2>

<img src="Book Images/6.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>A carefully crafted novel, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU inhabits a strange interstitial space between a whodunit, a crime novel 
that investigates personal and collective memory, a critique of socal media as a place where context is lost while no mistake goes 
unpunished and a literary novel about a woman reckoning with her past while trying to navigate her tumultuous present. What is right? 
What is wrong? Can we ever know the truth about things we weren't there to witness?</p>

<p>A successful film professor and podcaster, Bodie Kane is content to forget her past - the family tragedy that marred her adolescence, 
her four largely miserable years at a New Hampshire boarding school and the murder of her former roommate, Thalia Keith, in the spring 
of their senior year. Though the circumstances surrounding Thalia's death and the conviction of the school's athletic trainer, Omar Evans, 
are hotly debated online, Bodie would rather let sleeping dogs lie. When the Granby School invites her back to teach, Bodie is inexorably 
drawn to the case and its increasingly apparent flaws. In their rush to convict Omar, did the school and the police overlook other suspects. 
Is the real killer still out there? As she falls dow the very rabbit hole she was so determined to avoid, Bodie begins to wonder if she 
wasn't as much of an outsider at Granby as she'd thought - if she knew something that might have been key to solving the case back in 1995.</p>

<p>In making this novel, Makkai has crafted her most irresistible one yet: a stirring investigation into collective memory and a deeply 
felt examination of one woman's reckoning with her past, with a transfixing mystery at its heart. Timely, hypnotic and populated with a 
cast of unforgettable characters, I Have Some Questions For You already seems to be a compulsive page-turner and a literary triumph.</p>

<h2>Yellowface</h2>

<img src="Book Images/7.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>Mighty and merciless, YELLOWFACE is the sort of book that you could read in one sitting with it being so gripping. It is a dark 
satire that mirrors publishing, plagiarism and pessimism polished with desperation and dreams - driven by the age of social media 
and saddening realism. A detailed and fascinating portrayal of the publishing industry, dark unseen depths are exposed while the 
issue of race is explored from a literary perspective.</p>

<p>Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars: same year at Yale and same debut year in publishing.
However Athena is now a cross-genre literary darling and June didn't even get a paperback release. So when June witnesses Athena's 
death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse and steals Athena's recently finished masterpiece. The work in question is an 
experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese labourers to the British and French war efforts during World War I.</p>

<p>So what if June edits Athena's novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? Doesn't this piece of history deserve to be told, 
whoever the teller? That's what June thinks and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree...</p>

<p>With a completely immersive first-person voice, Yellowface takes on questions of diversity, racism and cultural appropriation not 
only in the publishing industry but the persistent erasure of Asian-American voices and history from society. R. F. Kuang's novel is 
timely, razor-sharp and eminently readable.</p>

<h2>Secretly Yours</h2>

<img src="Book Images/8.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>This is the first of many books by Tessa Bailey in the Vine Mess series about life in a California vineyard. This steamy opposites 
attract story is fun and light-hearted, making for the perfect start to an amazing new series. A great read for anyone who enjoys romance 
while it is a bit of a slow burn leading up to it. </p>

<p>Hallie Welch fell hard for Julian Vos at fourteen after they almost kissed in the dark vineyards of his family's winery. Now she has 
returned to Napa Valley, hired to revamp the gardens on the Vos estate, but she wonders if she'll finally get that smooch. The starchy 
professor isn't the teenager she remembers though. Their polar opposite personalities clash spectacularly as well. For Julian, his time 
at Vos Vineyards as strictly business. He's there to finish writing his novel without interruption but as vibrant Hallie enters his life 
so too do a series of strange letters from a secret admirer.</p>

<p>One wine-fuelled girls' night later, Hallie can't shake the sense that she did something reckless. It's then that she remembers the 
letter she drunkenly wrote and left for Julian. Shit... Hallie is quickly becoming a burst of colour in Julian's greyscale life. For a man 
who irons his socks and runs on tight schedules, her sunny and chaotic schedule makes zero sense. But there's something so familiar about 
her and her presence alone his turning his world upside down.</p>

<p>Bailey delivers a second-chance romance with vigour and passion, despite the characters falling a bit too neatly and exaggeratedly into 
a familiar grumpy/sunshine dichotomy. Witty banter and gripping tension both make this an absolute treat for fans of the series.</p>

<h2>Untethered Sky</h2>

<img src="Book Images/9.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>Fonda Lee's delicate coming-of-age novella UNTETHERED SKY, inspired by Persian and Arabian folklore, features two beasts from Middle Eastern 
mythology: manticores and rocs. The manticore, which derives its name from the Persian word for "man-eater", is a fearsome beast with a human-like 
head, the body of a lion and a scorpion-like tail. It has only one natural predator: a giant bird known a the roc. The roc, appearing in both 
Arabian and Persian mythology, is essentially a supersized falcon that can be trained to hunt a variety of beasts, including the manticore.</p>

<p>Untethered Sky is told from the first-person perspective of Ester, a girl who lost both her mother and brother to a rampaging manticore. With 
the manticore's sinister, heterochromic eyes emblazoned in her memory, Ester makes it her life's mission to hunt and kill manticores by training 
as a ruhker, i.e., a professional roc trainer. The job is highly dangerous since any miscommunication could mean it attacks its own handler. Only 
about one in five successfully complete their training.</p>

<p>With Untethered Sky, Lee shows her maturity and versatility as an author. This is a perfectly crafted gem which reinforces her standing 
as one of the most talented writers in fantasy. The writing is precise with every word chosen carefully and poetic with every line flowing 
beautifully. Gentle didacticism and quiet restraint are combined, giving it the feeling of a classic folktale. The Middle Eastern-inspired 
setting is an ideal backdrop for a tale that interweaves fantastical elements into the graceful story about the nature of humanity, our 
relationships with each other and mankind's place in the natural world. An understated approach is the perfect vehicle for this moving novella 
about rising from tragedy to find one's true calling.</p>

<h2>All The Dangerous Things</h2>

<img src="Book Images/10.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>ALL THE DANGEROUS THINGS is a lyrical, immersive mystery that delves into one mother's waking nightmare and the dark secrets she will uncover as 
she seeks the truth about two tragedies that have defined her life. It delves into every mother's worst nightmare as the disappearnce of an infant 
son is investigated. With twists and turns at every corner, this is one of those rare books that is genuinely impossible to put down.</p>

<p>One year ago, Isabelle Drake's life changed forever. Her toddler son, Mason, was taken out of his crib in the middle of the night while she and 
her husband were asleep in the next room. With little evidence and few leads for the police to chanse, the case quickly went cold. However, Isabelle 
cannot rest until Mason is returned to her - literally. Apart from the occasional catnap or a small blackout where she loses track of time, she 
hasn't slept in a year. Her entire existence now revolves around finding him, but she knows it can't go on like this forever. In the hopes of jarring
