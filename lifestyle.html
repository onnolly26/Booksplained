<h2>Fishing</h2>

<img src="Book Images/50.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>Al McGlashan's love the of the ocean saw him turn his back on the corporate world to take on a career as a photographer, journalist and filmmaker. His drive turned his passion for 
fishing into a successful business and he now sells his expertise worldwide. After two decades he is now one of Australia’s most reknowned fishing profiles and according to Al ‘he never

<h2>Cooking</h2>

<img src="Book Images/51.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<div style="padding:5px">
<p>Make a fire. fake a fire. roast your oysters. dance for pipis. slow it down. raise a toast. take lunch. grill a salad. bake a crab. step outside. burn your pav. pass the salt. eat with 
your hands. chew on the bone. The essential book on modern Australian food from leading cook and thinker Mat Lindsay. An opinionated but formality-free lesson in cooking with more flavour, 
vegetables, seafood, fire, balance, snacks, toast and flair.</p>

<p>Mat Lindsay's cooking resists easy labels. Certainly it's a distinct kind of full-flavoured Australian food: generous, mindfully chosen seafood; darkly caramelised wood-fired bread; 
vegetables cooked to just the right level of doneness; meat that's been treated with respect and, often, time; and the odd burnt pavlova, a true signature. Ester the restaurant is all about 
its wood-fired oven and the magic it imparts, but the fundamentals don't change at home, and everything in this book can be made delicious wherever you live.</p>

<p>Ester is an invitation to play with your food and enjoy the adventure. It's born of an eponymous restaurant in inner Sydney, but it's proudly not a restaurant book. Think of it more as 
the foundations for some new ideas in your kitchen and at your table; written to be used, shared, read aloud, perhaps burnt.</p>

<p>This is a truly beautiful book that shares meaning in the food we eat and make; the food we harvest and cook. Mat and Pat’s contents are divided into 11 comprehensive chapters that all 
home cooks with an insatiable appetite for creating dishes for family and friends, gatherings and comfort will appreciate</p>

mind of one of the most intelligent, analytical, and creative basketball players ever.</p>

<p>When shopping in person, you can try clothes on, see how they fit and feel the materials and craftsmanship of each piece. Another benefit of shopping 
in person is the option to ask questions; don't be afraid to talk to sales associates, who can offer a wealth of information about different clothing 
styles. GUIDE TO THE FEEL-GOOD FASHION is not about changing your lifestyle, but about making your wardrobe sustainable for your lifestyle and helping 
others along the way.</p>

<p>An extremely prominent sentiment in current culture is that fast fashion is democratic. "Design for all" is the mantra, and women in first-world 
countries claim it is their right to be able to afford luxury fashion at Wal-Mart prices. This book will help you to realise that your purchases do 
matter, and it will give you the tools to think of the big picture before making your next purchase. Your wardrobe will be better, your wallet will be 
heavier, and the world will be a better place.</p>

both gun and bow for feral game, rabbits, pigs and deer in both Australia and New Zealand. It also has additional chapters on fishing, camping, canoeing and 
photography.</p>

<p>One of his latest and also one of his greatest, this is one that perfectly instructs and teaches us about something humans have always done and will always 
do. Al McGlashan is passionate about the natural world and everything it provides. A keen adventurer, his love for being in the fresh air ultimately steered 
him away from the corporate world and into a career as a journalist. He is the author of four excellent books in outdoor recreation which includes best sellers.</p>
